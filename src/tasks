Things to change

v1. Remove all the static variables if possible
v2. Merge Controller, view and menu validator, simplify the structure
v3. Use regex to validate the input of plate number, no plate should be created if the format is not correct
4. Rewrite the entities, minimise the usage of getters and setters following the principle of OOP
v5. CalcService: review the generics methods and correct them
v6. Run the app from main method, not from view controller etc
v7. Plate attributes should take it's correct value instead of all string
v8. plate input string has to convert the string to upper case
9. dependency injection

plate regex:

^(8[789]|(9[0-9]|0[0-9]|1[0-2]|1[3-7][12]))[C|CE|CN|CW|D|DL|G|KE|KK|KY|L|LD|LH|LK|LM|LS|MH|MN|MO|OY|RN|SO|TN|TS|W|WD|WH|WX|WW][1-9][0-9]{0,5}$
